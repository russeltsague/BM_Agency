IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES
================================================================================

⚠️  CRITICAL: Change all passwords immediately in production environment!

⚠️  These are development credentials - never use in production systems.

⚠️  Regularly audit user roles and remove unnecessary admin access.

⚠️  Implement password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements).

⚠️  Enable 2FA for admin accounts in production.

================================================================================
