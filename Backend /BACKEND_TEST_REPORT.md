## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue: MongoDB Atlas Connection

### Problem
The backend cannot connect to MongoDB Atlas due to IP whitelist restrictions:

```
Error: Could not connect to any servers in your MongoDB Atlas cluster. 
One common reason is that you're trying to access the database from an IP 
that isn't whitelisted.
```

### Solution Required
You need to whitelist your IP address in MongoDB Atlas:

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Navigate to your cluster
3. Click on "Network Access" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Add IP Address"
5. Either:
   - Click "Add Current IP Address" (recommended for development)
   - Or add `0.0.0.0/0` to allow access from anywhere (less secure, but useful for testing)
6. Save the changes

## üìö API Documentation

Once the server is running and MongoDB is connected, you can access:

**Swagger API Documentation:** http://localhost:5000/api-docs

This provides interactive API documentation where you can:
- View all endpoints
- See request/response schemas
- Test endpoints directly from the browser

---

## üß™ Test Suite Created

Test files have been created in `src/__tests__/`:

1. **setup.ts** - Test environment configuration
2. **auth.test.ts** - Authentication endpoint tests
3. **services.test.ts** - Services CRUD operation tests
4. **health.test.ts** - Health check and 404 handler tests

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
```

**Note:** Tests require MongoDB Memory Server which had download issues. Once MongoDB Atlas connection is working, you can test endpoints manually or fix the test setup.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Fix MongoDB Atlas Connection**
   - Whitelist your IP address in MongoDB Atlas
   - Verify connection string is correct

2. **Test API Endpoints**
   - Once MongoDB is connected, test registration endpoint
   - Create an admin user
   - Test all CRUD operations

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Update Frontend API base URL to `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`
   - Configure axios or fetch client
   - Implement authentication flow
   - Connect all frontend components to backend endpoints

### Testing Commands

Once MongoDB is connected, you can test with curl:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Register a user
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'

# Get all services
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/services
```
